My main goal in pursuing this course is to be able to do something important and meaningful with the skills I learn. Currently I work at Starbucks, and while there's plenty that I enjoy about the work, I don't feel like what I do matters, or that there would be any difference if (or realistically, when) the work is replaced by automation. I want to do something that helps people.

I've chosen software engineering because I have a little experience with programming already, and really enjoyed the problem solving involved in it. I started out in college as an Environmental Engineering major, but quickly switched to Computer Science after I took my first coding class because it was that interesting. I later transferred schools and switched majors again to Game Design. I originally intended to pursue the programming part of Game Design, but after discovering how much fun 3D modeling and animation were, I switched to Art. Now I'm back to pick up where I left off and have another skill that I can make a career out of!
