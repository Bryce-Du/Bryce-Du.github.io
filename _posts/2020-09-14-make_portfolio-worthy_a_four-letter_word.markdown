When I graduated from college with a degree in Interactive Media and Game Design, I felt it was paramount that I put together a portfolio of my art and animation that would be guaranteed to get me a job in the industry. Every day in the summer after I left school I would open up some art program and set out to make a "portfolio-worthy" masterpiece. And after a few hours of agony, I would close said art program without saving any of the "unworthy" work that I had done and play video games instead. This continued for a few months until eventually I just stopped trying, convinced that the work I had done in school was just a fluke and that my life as an artist wasn't meant to be.

I felt a need to make art that reflected me as an artist, and the fact that I didn't make any art at all is a pretty horrifying reflection. If I was to be employed in an incredibly competitive environment I would need my art to be perfect, to demonstrate that *I* was perfect. The very pressure to turn art into something functional conflicted with the reality that the best art is never perfect, or at least that aiming for perfection makes for much worse art than aiming for something specific, imperfect, and good.

My inability to make portfolio-worthy work then meant that *I* was unworthy, and I certainly felt that way. The way I saw it, I had obviously peaked in school, and as soon as I was forced to operate outside of a rigid school environment I failed miserably. What followed were several years of depression that I had to slowly build my way out of with help from friends and family. It wasn't cute! It's a conflicting feeling, I'm deeply embarassed by my depression, but proud of who I became in spite of it. I don't know how to "own" this time in my life, or if I'm even supposed to own it.

If I then had the resilience I've grown into in more recent years, I probably would have asked a really interesting question: "What was it about the work I did in school that was actually pretty good, dare I say, portfolio-worthy?" And I think with a bit of reflection I would have discovered an even more interesting answer: I wasn't trying to make art that was so good it would all but entitle me to a job, I was making art to learn, to push myself, and because it was FUN.

I came up against this same struggle here at Flatiron, at the beginning of each project. I knew if I made a project that was truly perfect, it would make the job search much easier. And thus the first day or two of each project week was spent not coding, not planning, not diagramming, but doing that completely unimportant task: stressing. 

I pushed myself to just get started on anything, even if whatever code I wrote ended up completely scrapped. This same pattern emerged for every project: I would waste a few days feeling stressed that the outcomes wouldn't be what I wanted, and then I would just get started. From whatever starting point I ended up establishing, I couldn't stop myself from just finishing the project as quickly as possible. As soon as I made the first jump, the whole process flowed so easily, and I didn't even want to indulge in my typical distractions anymore. The reason was obvious: I was just having fun making code.

When I stopped thinking about the final product, I was able to actually make a product at all.

Being a part of a really great cohort helped me see things more clearly. None of their projects were perfect either! But they were very good! And they demonstrated the considerable amount each of us had learned. Learning was the goal after all, not perfection. Maybe our imperfection had something to do with the fact that we were all students, learning how to use this tech for the very first time and figuring things out as we went. It wasn't supposed to be perfect or easy, if it was, it wouldn't really even be worth doing. What would a perfect project show, except that we were only willing to stay in our comfort zones doing work that was "in our wheelhouse"?

I've now begun reminding myself that perfect is the enemy of good. I know I enjoy this work, I know the most uncomfortable part is the very beginning, and that the rest just flows easily. If I let myself be afraid of starting, I'm really just prolonging how much time the *worst part* takes! So from now on I'm maximizing the joy of the work that I do, by just getting started on something and making it fun. Thinking about projects only having "worth" if they are perfect gems for your portfolio is just a completely inaccurate view of work. That feeling of fun is where the best work originates, and having fun means the work was inherently worth doing.

I've been genuinely terrified of this job search going the way my previous attempts have, but I'm starting to take account of just how much I've grown, and how much support I've found in others along the way. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still a little scared, but at least now I can see the real steps between me and my goals.
